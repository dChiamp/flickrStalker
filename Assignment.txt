FLICKR STALKR - Again, this is a rather hefty synthesis challenge! 

The goal of this assignment is to get images from flickr that have geo tags and (creepily) map them using Google Map's street view API.  Check out Assignment_Solution1.png & Assignment_Solution2.png to see the solution in action.

I've provided:
	* A project with animate.css already set up
	* A basic search page with a search result template div for you to clone.  There's a spot for:
		- Flickr image
		- Street view image
		- Flickr username
		- Flickr title
	* A form with a text input (that has autocomplete turned off)

I'm going to give you the order in which you should tackle the parts of this project:
	1. Get the flickr API search working.
	2. Put the flickr image, username & title on the page.
	3. Get the street view image for each flickr image.
	5. Add enhancements, some ideas:
		- CSS3 animations to make the results fade in
		- Animation delays so that the street view image loads after the flickr image
		- Animation delays so that the search results load one after another
		- CSS3 transitions to make the street view image "zoom" when the mouse hovers over it (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)
		- Extend the form so that users can control whether they are searching tags or text.
		- Extend the form so that users can control how the search results are sorted.

Flickr:
	* You'll probably want to do a search for photos using "method=flickr.photos.search".
	* You can sort the results in different ways.  I recommend relevance, interestingness-desc, date-taken-desc or interestingness.  Or, you could create another form input that allows the user to choose :) 
	* You can search using tags or text.  I recommend tags.  Or, you could create another form input...
	* Is there a way to guarantee that the photos have a geolocation?  How do you get the username?
	* Relevant documentation:
		- https://www.flickr.com/services/api/
		- https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.overview.html
		- https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html
	* You have to do a little work to construct an image URL from a search result: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html

Google Street View Image API:
	* This is a bit different than other APIs.  You don't have to make a request using an XMLHttpRequest object.  The API call URL can be directly put into the src tag on an image.  Try it out in the browser.
	* Documentation:

General tips
	* COMMENT YOUR CODE!  Leave notes that explain what the different parts of 
	  your program do.
	* Debug small chunks of code and debug often.  Don't try to code 
	  everything all at once!
	* Plan before you start coding.  Paper & pencil are helpful in wrapping
	  your head around a problem.
